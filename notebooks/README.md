# Notebooks

This directory contains various notebooks for tracking phylogenies in various languages/frameworks:

* `phylotrackpy-async-gen-example.ipynb` contains an example using [phylotrackpy](https://pypi.org/project/phylotrackpy/) (a python phylogeny tracker) in a system with asynchronous generations.
* `phylotrackpy-sync-gen-example.ipynb` contains an example using `phylotrackpy` in a system with synchronous generations
* `julia-coevolution-example.ipynb` that contains an example using [Jevo.jl](https://jarbus.net/Jevo.jl/dev/), an experimental (co-)evolutionary computing framework written in Julia with built-in phylogeny tracking. We *highly* recommend using [the colab version of this notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D_8GyL2skTl7t85G5GXqknPbdAlnwZ-W) to save battery and to quickly download the dependencies.
